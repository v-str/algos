# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Tree, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array_. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
```

Explanation:
- Level 0: 3 → avg = 3
- Level 1: (9 + 20) / 2 = 14.5
- Level 2: (15 + 7) / 2 = 11

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
