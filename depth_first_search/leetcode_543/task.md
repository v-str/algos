# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
```

Explanation: The diameter is of length 3 (path 4 → 2 → 1 → 3 or 5 → 2 → 1 → 3).

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
